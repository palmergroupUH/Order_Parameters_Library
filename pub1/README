The Workflow to perform Bhatia-Thornton Analysis in water-like system: 

                      By Jingxiang Guo 09/18/2020 

===============================================================================

Section 1:

* Label and high and low q species 
* compute their pair correlations 	

===============================================================================

1. compute the tetrahedral order parameter, q for each particle in the system
	
	a. use enough large cutoff such that every molecuel has at least 4 neighbors 

	b. sort all neighbors to find 4 nearest neighbors and compute q from equation 
 
2. label each particle as either "High q" or "Low q" 

	a. use certain sorting algorithm ( quick sort used here ) to sort the q from smallest to largest and find q median 

	b. if q < q median then, "Low q" and if q > q_median, "High q " 

3. compute the distance pair correlation between: 

	High q - High q 

	High q - Low q

	Low q - Low q 

	all particles 

4. dump the historgram of each type of pair corrlation to a file "RDF_HIST_'type'_'num_frames'.txt" 

	a. Note: histogram is not normalized by density, total number of particles and local shell volume 

	b. historgram file format:
	
	first row: N,Total number of particles accumulated each frame ( N = N + N_at_each_frame) 

	second row: V,total volumes accumulated at each frame ( V = V + V_at_each_frame)  

	third row: N-1,total_number of particles except reference particle its self ( N-1 = N-1 + N-1_at_each_frame)  

	fourth row: total number of frames ( frame_counter = frame_counter + 1)  

	fifth row: interval after choosing historgram bins ( half_box_size-0 )/num_bins

Wait for step 4 to finish..............

===============================================================================

Section 2: 

* compute finite-size corrected homogeneous and binary mixtures structure factors	
* compute Bhatia Thornton structure factors

===============================================================================

5. read each type distance pair correlation histogram from file and compute binary partial structure factors

	a. finite-size correction is used to computet all types of the pair correaltion function ( this is normalized ) 

	b. finite-size correction is also used in computing partial structure factor but using uncorrected pair correlation  

	c. different ranges of R, less than or equal to half of box size are used in compute the corrections: 
	
		silica: 4.28nm-4.3nm 

		ST2: 4.0nm - 5.0nm for all structure factors and 3.0nm-3.5nm for pair correlations functions corrections ( following same range used in Patey's papers )  
			
6. compute the N-N ( density-dnesity), N-C (density-concentration)  and C-C (concentration-concentration ) structure factors from Bhatia-Thornton mehod

	a. With the same scattering length of each binary species, N-N structure factors is conceptually same as fourier transform of all particle pair correlation

	b. By convention, total structure factor can be split into normal compoent + anomalous structure factor

	b. Uncoupled density and concentration structure factor, which is the normal compoent of total structure is also obtained from Bhatia-Thornton analysis. 

	c. Anomalous part of total structure factor is computed as S_total - S_normal 

8. Fit both the anomalous part of total structure factor and concentration structure factor to Lorentzian form 

	a. define the region starting at qmin: (2*pi)/(half of box size) 

	b. starting from qmin, locate qmax where of 1/SA or 1/SCC vs. q^2  is linear  ( qmin < q < qmax)  

	c. compute the correlation length as  

9. Fit the correlation length to a power-law form: correlation length =e0*(T/Tc-1)^-v

	a. fix critical expoent v=0.63 ( Assuming Ising Universality is true for tetrahedral system)  

	b. adjust parameters: Tc and e0 to best fit the correaltion length vs T/Tc-1 

	c. The error bars of correlation length based on block analysis has to be taken into account in fitting 

	d. Block analysis here is done by dividing the whole trajectories into 3-5 blocks equally and estimate the correlation length from each block

Section 3: 

* Perform the fitting to the Lorenzian form

* Perform the fitting of the correlation length
